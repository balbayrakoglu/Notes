About Me — Burak Albayrakoglu

Senior Java/Spring Engineer & Product-minded Builder. System design, microservices, Kafka/RabbitMQ, and pragmatic DevEx. I also work across Retail Media (Martailer) and IoT (Blynk) content and tooling.

Summary

8+ years building backend services with Java 17 / Spring Boot 3.

Strong in distributed systems: Kafka/RabbitMQ, outbox/inbox, idempotency, resiliency (CB/Retry/Bulkhead).

Data access at scale: JPA performance, query tuning, pagination strategies, caching (Caffeine/Redis).

System design for payments, retail media platforms, fleet/IoT integrations.

Hands-on testing: Testcontainers, contract tests, meaningful coverage, CI/CD gates.

Clean code: hexagonal boundaries, package-by-feature, MapStruct, DTO discipline.

Product mindset: “ship it safe”, zero-drama releases (blue/green/canary), SLO-driven ops.

Strengths (at a glance)

Turning vague requirements into precise APIs and stable releases.

Finding the simplest design that can evolve safely.

Debugging production issues quickly with metrics/logs/traces.

Explaining trade-offs clearly (latency vs. throughput, consistency vs. availability).

Focus Areas

Java 17 / Spring Boot 3 in production.

Messaging patterns (Kafka/RabbitMQ) with exactly-once-enough semantics.

Performance: N+1 avoidance, keyset pagination, batch writes, connection pool tuning.

Observability: Micrometer + Prometheus/Grafana, OpenTelemetry tracing, JSON logs with MDC.

Tech Stack

Languages: Java (primary), SQL, a bit of Python/JS where needed

Frameworks: Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Cloud, MapStruct

Infra: Docker, K8s, AWS, Redis, Postgres

Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ

Testing: JUnit 5, Testcontainers, WireMock / MockServer

Notable Work / Themes

Retail Media orchestration (inventory, booking, analytics, SP ads)

Payments & idempotent APIs (safeguards against double charges)

IoT integrations & telemetry pipelines (Blynk)

Current Goals

Sharpen system-design answers with runnable examples.

Extend notes: advanced Kafka (DLT/Retry/Streams), Spring Cache + Redis patterns, MapStruct cookbook.

Publish public “Master Notes” for other engineers.

How to Use These Notes

Start with Core Java → Spring → Microservices.

Skim each section’s Senior-level TL;DR, then deep-dive only where needed.

Use Quick Cheatsheets before interviews and on-call sessions.
